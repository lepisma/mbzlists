Self hosted, login-less, /annotated playlist manager/ based on Musicbrainz IDs. It
came from the need of curating /static/ music playlists that not tied to any
platform silos and that allow sharing more context than just a list of
songs. With mbzlists, you can create and share a sort of /playlist blogs/ that can
be reduced to plain lists for playback or compatibility as needed. Here is an
example:

A public version is hosted at [[https://mbzlists.com/][https://mbzlists.com/]] which you can use. To self
host, you can do the following:

All data is kept in a single SQLite database for now. Create a data directory
for keeping this file and then run the docker image using the following:

#+begin_src shell
  docker run -d \
    -v "$(pwd)/data:/data" \
    -p 3000:3000 \
    -e PUBLIC_BASE_URL="https//mbzlists.com/" \
    --name mbzlists \
    lepisma/mbzlists:0.2.0
#+end_src

mbzlists depends on great projects like [[https://musicbrainz.org/][musicbrainz]], [[https://listenbrainz.org/][listenbrainz]], and [[https://editorjs.io/][editorjs]],
among others to function.
