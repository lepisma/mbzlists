Self hosted, login-less, universal playlists manager based on Musicbrainz
IDs. It came from the need of curating /static/ music playlists that not tied to
any platform silos.

A public version is hosted at [[https://mbzlists.com/][https://mbzlists.com/]] which you can use. To self
host, you can do the following:

Create a data directory for keeping SQLite database and then run mount it using
the following:

#+begin_src shell
  docker run -d \
    -v "$(pwd)/data:/data" \
    -p 3000:3000 \
    -e PUBLIC_BASE_URL="https//mbzlists.com/" \
    --name mbzlists \
    mbzlists:latest
#+end_src
