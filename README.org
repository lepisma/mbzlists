All data is kept in a single SQLite database for now. Create a data directory
for keeping this file and then run the docker image using the following:

#+begin_src shell
  docker run -d \
    -v "$(pwd)/data:/data" \
    -p 3000:3000 \
    -e PUBLIC_BASE_URL="https//mbzlists.com/" \
    --name mbzlists \
    lepisma/mbzlists:0.1.0
#+end_src
